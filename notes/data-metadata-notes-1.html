          <p>
            The <code>data-auth</code>
            proposal would help identify statutory provisions that assign authority to a government official or government entity (<i>e.g.</i>, department, agency, office, etc.)
          </p>
          <p>Currently, it is being decided whether the <code>data-auth</code> attribute should have a three-part value that would identify, the person to whom authority is assigned, whether such authority is mandatory or discretionary, and the type of authority being assigned. So, for example, mandatory rulemaking authority assigned to a government department would look like this: <code>data-auth=<q>department/mandatory/rulemaking</q></code>.</p>
          <p>Initally, the thought was that the two acceptable values for this attribute would be <code>discretionary</code> or <code>mandatory</code>.</p>
