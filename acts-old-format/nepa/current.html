In the case of any facility or site not in operation at the time a determination is made to require corrective action, if the director finds that the owner could not reasonably be expected to have actual knowledge of the presence of hazardous waste at the site, the director may issue an order requiring any previous owner or operator who could reasonably be expected to have actual knowledge to carry out the necessary monitoring, investigation, and corrective action.</p>

The director may grant such variance if he or she finds that the emissions or discharges occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger or tend to endanger human health or safety or that compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public. In making such findings the director shall give due consideration to all the facts and circumstances bearing upon the reasonableness of the emissions or discharges involved including, but not limited to:</p>
        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1513(1)(a)">(a) The character and degree of injury to or interference with the health and physical property of the people;</p>

Before any variance is granted, the director shall give public notice of an application for such variance immediately upon receipt of such application and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the department. The notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the plant, building structure, process, or equipment on which the proposed variance is located.</p>

        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1513(3)(a)">(a) If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement, or control of the air, water, or land pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement, or control become known and available and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the director may prescribe;</p>
        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1513(3)(b)">(b) If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the director, is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified in this section shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable; and</p>
        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1513(3)(c)">(c) If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in subdivision <a href="#81-1513(3)(a)">(a)</a> or <a href="#81-1513(3)(b)">(b)</a> of this subsection, it shall be for not more than one year.</p>
      <p class="lvl1" id="81-1513(4)">(4) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint is made to the director on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted unless the director finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an application for renewal and before approving the renewal application, the director shall give public notice of such application in accordance with rules and regulations of the department.

The department shall examine and consider regulatory programs created by other states and the federal government, their applicability to Nebraska, and their success in the states or areas where they are used and shall consider, but not be limited to, the following policy options:</p>
        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1531.02(1)(a)">(a) The development of uranium surface and shaft mining regulations;</p>

      <p class="lvl1" id="81-1531.02(3)">(3) Uranium mining by any method other than mineral production and injection wells shall be prohibited until legislation is passed authorizing the department to regulate such mining activities. It is the intent of the Legislature that uranium mining shall be regulated by the department. Upon receipt of evidence that uranium mining by any method other than by mineral production and injection wells or related activities are presenting or are likely to present an imminent and substantial threat to the environment, the director shall petition the district court for an injunction to immediately restrain any person from contributing to the alleged acts or to require any person to stop such acts or to take such other action as may be necessary. It shall be the duty of each county attorney or the Attorney General to whom the director reports a violation to cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted without delay to assure compliance with this section.</p>
