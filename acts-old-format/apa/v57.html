All parties of record shall be made parties to the proceedings for review. A party of record for district court proceedings for review shall include any person who appeared either personally or through an attorney, who was a participant in the agency&rsquo;s contested hearing, and who was treated as a party by the agency&rsquo;s hearing officer. If an agency&rsquo;s only role in a contested case is to act as a neutral factfinding body, the agency shall not be a party of record. In all other cases, the agency shall be a party of record. Summons shall be served on the agency within thirty days of the filing of the petition in the manner provided for service of a summons in section 25-510.02. Summons on any nongovernmental parties shall be served within thirty days of the filing of the petition in the manner provided for service of summons in a civil action. If the agency whose decision is appealed from is not a party of record, the petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition and a request for preparation of the official record upon the agency within thirty days of the filing of the petition. The court, in its discretion, may permit other interested persons to intervene.</p>
        <p id="84-917(2)(a)(ii)" class="lvl3">(ii) The filing of a petition for review shall vest in a responding party of record the right to a cross-appeal against any other party of record.

        <p id="84-917(3)" class="lvl1">(3) The filing of the petition or the service of summons upon such agency shall not stay enforcement of a decision. The agency may order a stay. The court may order a stay after notice of the application therefor to such agency and to all parties of record. If the agency has found that its action on an application for stay or other temporary remedies is justified to protect against a substantial threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, the court may not grant relief unless the court finds that: 
          <span id="84-917(3)(a)">(a) The applicant is likely to prevail when the court finally disposes of the matter;</span>
          <span id="84-917(3)(b)">(b) without relief, the applicant will suffer irreparable injuries;</span>
          <span id="84-917(3)(c)">(c) the grant of relief to the applicant will not substantially harm other parties to the proceedings; and</span>
          <span id="84-917(3)(d)">(d) the threat to the public health, safety, or welfare relied on by the agency is not sufficiently serious to justify the agency&rsquo;s action in the circumstances.</span>
          The court may require the party requesting such stay to give bond in such amount and conditioned as the court may direct.
        </p>
        <p id="84-917(4)" class="lvl1">(4) Within thirty days after service of the petition or within such further time as the court for good cause shown may allow, the agency shall prepare and transmit to the clerk of the district court in which the petition is filed a certified copy of the official record of the proceedings had before the agency. Such official record shall include:

          <span id="84-917(4)(d)">(d) the final order appealed from. The agency shall charge the petitioner with the reasonable direct cost or require the petitioner to pay the cost for preparing the official record for transmittal to the court in all cases except when the petitioner is not required to pay a filing fee.</span>
          The agency may require payment or bond prior to the transmittal of the record. The official record shall be considered by the court without being offered and received in evidence.

        <p id="84-917(5)(b)(i)" class="lvl3">(i) If the court determines that the interest of justice would be served by the resolution of any other issue not raised before the agency, the court may remand the case to the agency for further proceedings.</p>
        <p id="84-917(5)(b)(ii)" class="lvl3">(ii) The agency shall affirm, modify, or reverse its findings and decision in the case by reason of the additional proceedings and shall file the decision following remand with the reviewing court. The agency shall serve a copy of the decision following remand upon all parties to the district court proceedings. The agency decision following remand shall become final unless a petition for further review is filed with the reviewing court within thirty days after the decision following remand being filed with the district court. The party filing the petition for further review shall serve a copy of the petition for further review upon all parties to the district court proceeding in accordance with the rules of pleading in civil actions promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to section 25-801.01 within thirty days after the petition for further review is filed. Within thirty days after service of the petition for further review or within such further time as the court for good cause shown may allow, the agency shall prepare and transmit to the court a certified copy of the official record of the additional proceedings had before the agency following remand.</p>
