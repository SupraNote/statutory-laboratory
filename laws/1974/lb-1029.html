        <p class="lvl2" id="81-1513(3)(b)">(b) If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the director, is requisite for the taking of necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified in this section shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable; and</p>

No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an application for renewal the direction shall give public notice of such application in accordance with rules and regulations of the department.</p>
      <p class="lvl1" id="81-1513(5)">(5) A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder thereof but shall be in the discretion of the director.
